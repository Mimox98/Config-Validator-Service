## Overview

The Config Validator Service is a small but realistic internal tool that demonstrates how Docker containerization and Jenkins automation can significantly improve developer productivity.

## The Problem

Development teams face several common pain points:

- **Environment inconsistencies**: "Works on my machine" problems slow down debugging
- **Manual validation**: Developers waste time manually checking configuration files
- **Late error detection**: Config errors discovered in production cause incidents
- **Onboarding friction**: New developers spend hours setting up tools

## The Solution

This project addresses these issues through:

### 1. Docker Containerization
A single Docker image packages the entire validation service with all dependencies. Every developer and the CI system use exactly the same environment.

**Benefit**: No more "missing dependency" or "wrong Python version" issues.

### 2. Automated Jenkins Pipeline
Jenkins automatically builds, tests, and validates configs on every change, providing fast feedback.

**Benefit**: Developers know within minutes if their configs are valid, not hours later in staging.

### 3. Reusable Template
The Dockerfile and Jenkinsfile are clean and generic, ready to be copied into other projects.

**Benefit**: New internal tools can be containerized and automated in minutes, not days.

## How It Works

```
Developer → Git Push → Jenkins Pipeline → Docker Build → Tests → Validation → Fast Feedback
```

1. Developer commits code changes
2. Jenkins detects the change
3. Pipeline builds a fresh Docker image
4. Unit tests run inside the container
5. Config files are validated automatically
6. Developer gets immediate feedback

## Key Technologies

- **Python & FastAPI**: Fast, modern API framework
- **Docker**: Consistent execution environment
- **Jenkins**: Automated CI/CD pipeline
- **pytest**: Reliable unit testing

## Getting Started

See the [Environment Setup](environment.qmd) guide to run this locally, or check the [Pipeline Documentation](pipeline.qmd) to understand the Jenkins automation.
